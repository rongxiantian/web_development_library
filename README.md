# web_development_library #
Based on struts2 frame, SQL Server database, Tomcat Server, and Myeclipes as IDE. 

The project supports several functions:

	1. authenticate user and administrator
	2. storage books
	3. issue library card
	4. borrow and return books
	5. get information on books and readers
	6. maintain information on books and readers
	7. overdue return treatment
	8. lost books or lost card treatment

I attached the experiment report in pdf format. It is written in Chinese, but you can still get the basic structure from screenshots.
